      "Why Now?   Billions of dollars in the United States have been spent on smart meters designed to enable energy savings in homes and businesses (where over 40 percent of our nation's energy is used). The most exciting new energy management technologies often depend upon customers having access to their energy data— both consumption and pricing information—as essential ingredients.Most customer benefits of these meters won't be realized until consumers have easy, functional access to their own energy data. Smart meters collect this data today, but rarely do utilities deliver it to consumers in a useful format. Standard formats and protocols for exchanging energy data are available and in use in a handful of states. But the lack of widespread implementation costs consumers important opportunities to save energy and money.",
